After spending three wonderful years at Pittsford Sutherland high school in upstate New York, I moved to UCLA in 2018, where I obtained bachelor's degrees on computer science and mathematics in 2021. I then entered the one-year master's program in computer science at the same place. Following the expected graduation in June 2022, I plan to start my Ph.D. at Princeton.
