Overview: this course consists of three components in computer science.
 - Language and standard libraries (C++).
 - Data structure
 - Algorithm design

C++ language in this course is a continuation from CS31.  

Data structure concerns about structures to store, query, look up, and update
data so that it fits into the problem setting and sometimes improves the
efficiency of the problem solving.
Sequential(1D) data structure example: 1D array (quick to access elements, but
slow to insert, delete, and look up).
Any better structures for looking up elements?
Tree (2D), (hash) map.
Some data structures are simply mathematical models. For instance, we use
graphs to model a map(like Google map), the internet, etc..

Algorithm design concerns about the efficiency of a program to solve a given
problem. For instance, given an array of N integers, the best way to check if
an integer k appears in the array is to loop through each one of them, which
takes in the worst case N iterations.
However, if let's say the array is sorted. For example 1 1 3 4 5 7 10 11 13 ...
Is there a faster way to check if k appears in it?
Yes, one can use a binary search algorithm.

For a program to be correct, it needs to satisfy the following two properties
in addition to compiling correctly:
 - It needs to terminate.
 - It computes the correct output.
People often overlook the termination condition, which introduces runtime 
issues.
